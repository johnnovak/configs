reaper.MB([[This script has been replaced by "js_Mouse editing - Draw ramp".

The new "Mouse editing" scripts require the js_ReaScriptAPI extension, and have several advantages:

* No helper scripts required for mousewheel control: 
The new scripts can detect mouse input themselves.

* Fewer scripts and fewer shortcuts: 
Since the new scripts can detect mouse input, each script can be multi-functional, 
and middle-click and right-click are used to switch between different modes. 
For example, a single new script, "js_Mouse editing - Draw ramp", combines and replaces four old scripts: 
"Draw linear or curved ramps in real time", "Draw linear or curved ramps in real time, chasing start values", "Draw sine curve in real time" and "Draw sine curve in real time, chasing start values".

* New editing features such as adjustable compression curves (in the "Stretch and Compress" script) or BÃ©zier smoothing (in the "Connect nodes" script).

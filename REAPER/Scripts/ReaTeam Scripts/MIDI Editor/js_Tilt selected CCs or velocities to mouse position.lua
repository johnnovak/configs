reaper.MB([[This script has been replaced by "js_Mouse editing - Arch and Tilt".

The new "Mouse editing" scripts require the js_ReaScriptAPI extension, and have several advantages:

* No helper scripts required for mousewheel control: 
The new scripts can detect mouse input themselves.

* Fewer scripts and fewer shortcuts: 
Since the new scripts can detect mouse input, each script can be multi-functional, 
and middle-click and right-click are used to switch between different modes. 
For example, the single new script, "js_Mouse editing - Arch and Tilt", combines and replaces three older scripts: 
"Arch with linear or power curve", "Arch with sine curve" and "Tilt".

* New editing features such as CC lane compression with customizable curves (in the "Stretch and Compress" script) or BÃ©zier smoothing (in the "Connect nodes" script).
